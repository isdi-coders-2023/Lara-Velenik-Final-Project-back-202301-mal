# üê±Hypocat Application Back Endüê±

The Hypocat Application Back End provides the API for the Hypocat web application, allowing users to search for hypoallergenic cats through ads, create, modify, and delete ads, and browse cat breeds.

# # Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal in the repository folder.
Run npm install to install the dependencies.

# # # Features

The Hypocat Application Back End provides the following features:

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for ads and cat breeds.
Integration with MongoDB, a document database, using Mongoose to model the data.
API built using Render, a cloud platform that simplifies deployment and scaling.
Storage and uploading of images and text files using Supabase and Multer.

# # # #Technologies Used

The Hypocat Application Back End is built using TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early and improve code quality.

To ensure code quality and consistency, the following tools are used:

Husky, Git hooks to automate tasks like code linting and formatting on pre-commit and pre-push.
ESLint, a pluggable linter for JavaScript and TypeScript that helps identify and fix issues in the codebase.
Prettier, an opinionated code formatter that ensures code consistency and makes it easier to read and understand.
SonarCloud, a cloud-based code quality and security analysis platform that checks the codebase for issues and vulnerabilities.
EditorConfig, a configuration file that helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs.
Testing is also an important part of the development process, and the following tools are used:

Jest, a testing framework that provides easy-to-use tools for unit and integration testing, with features like mocking, assertions, and snapshot testing.
Mock Service Worker, a library for mocking API requests and responses that allows us to test our app's behavior under various network conditions.
MongoDB Memory Server, a library for in-memory testing of MongoDB applications.
Supertest, a library for testing HTTP servers, making it easy to write tests for our API endpoints.
We strive to keep our codebase clean, organized, and maintainable, and these tools help us achieve that goal.
